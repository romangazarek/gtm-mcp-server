# Safe-Edit Workflow

All GTM changes must follow this sequence. Never skip steps.

## 1. Isolate

- Create a dedicated workspace for the change: `create_workspace` with a name describing the change (e.g. `Add GA4 ecommerce events`).
- Only use the Default Workspace for trivial single-entity fixes when the user says so.

## 2. Change

- Make all edits inside that workspace.
- Order of creation: variables → triggers → tags (later entities reference earlier ones).
- Check templates (`get_tag_templates` / `get_trigger_templates`) before constructing parameters.

## 3. Review

- Run `get_workspace_changes` and present the pending changes to the user as a diff summary: what is added, modified, deleted. It lists each changed entity by name and type, so the user can see the actual change rather than a count.
- Pass `verbose: true` when the user needs a field-level diff of an entity body. Use `get_workspace_status` when you only need the counts.
- A paused tag shows up as an `updated` change with `paused: true` — not as a deletion. Say so explicitly when presenting it.
- If there are merge conflicts, resolve them before proceeding.
- Do not proceed to versioning until the user has seen the summary.

## 4. Version

- `create_version` with a descriptive name and notes: what changed and why (e.g. `Add purchase + refund GA4 events for checkout revamp`).
- Version names like `v2` or `changes` fail review.

## 5. Publish — only with explicit approval

- `publish_version` requires `confirm: true` AND explicit user approval in conversation. Ask, wait for a yes, then publish.
- After publishing, tell the user the version ID so they can roll back.

## Rollback

- To roll back, republish the previous known-good version with `publish_version` — do not attempt to hand-revert entities in a new workspace.
- Use `list_versions` to find the previous live version.

## Never

- Never publish directly after editing without showing the workspace status.
- Never delete entities as part of an unrelated change; propose deletions separately.
- Never edit two unrelated concerns in one workspace.
